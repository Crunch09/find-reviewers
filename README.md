> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that randomly assigns reviewers out of a given list of
possible reviewers when a specified label
is added to a pull-request.

## Installation from the GitHub App Store

Go to https://github.com/apps/find-reviewers and follow the instructions.

## Configuration

Create a file `~/.github/reviewers.yml` in your repository to set up the configuration.

```yaml

# Describe the labels that once added to a pull request cause the app to assign
# randomly chosen reviewers.
labels:
  -
    # Define the groups of reviewers from which the reviewers will be chosen. In this
    # example, when the label `ready-for-review` is applied, two reviewers are
    # chosen from the first group and one reviewer from the second group.
    groups:
      -
        number_of_picks: 2
