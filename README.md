> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that randomly assigns reviewers out of a given list of
possible reviewers when a specified label
is added to a pull-request.

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

## Configuration

Create a file `~/.github/reviewers.yml` in your repository to set up the configuration.

# randomly chosen reviewers.

    # chosen from the first group and one reviewer from the second group.
